    <h1>Introduction to JProtobuf</h1>
    <p><strong>JProtobuf</strong> is a lightweight library developed by Baidu's team for simplifying the use of Google
        Protocol Buffers (protobuf) in Java applications.</p>

    <h2>Key Features and Information:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Definition and Principle:</strong> JProtobuf analyzes Java classes annotated with protobuf
            annotations and dynamically generates Java code for serialization and deserialization. It uses JDK6 or
            above's code compile API for compilation and loading into the classloader.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The main performance overhead of JProtobuf is in scanning class annotations
            and dynamically generating code for compilation. During serialization and deserialization, its efficiency is
            almost equivalent to the code generated by protobuf. Pre-compilation plugins can further enhance runtime
            performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>No need to write proto files or go through the tedious manual compilation process.</li>
                <li>Supports all protobuf types, including nested objects, arrays, and enum types.</li>
                <li>Provides dynamic generation of proxy objects based on proto files, eliminating the need for POJO
                    object writing.</li>
                <li>Supports automatic generation of proto files from POJO annotations, facilitating management and
                    maintenance of proto description files.</li>
                <li>Offers pre-compilation Maven and Gradle plugins for improved runtime performance.</li>
                <li>In version 2.x, it supports Timestamp type consistent with native protobuf and supports Date type
                    using long type for transmission.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Installation:</strong> JProtobuf can be included in your project by adding the library through Maven
            or Gradle. Dependency information can be found in the project's readme file.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> JProtobuf is suitable for big data processing, network communication, and
            distributed systems due to its efficient serialization performance. It simplifies the use of protobuf in
            scenarios such as data storage, RPC frameworks, and log processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Support and Documentation:</strong> JProtobuf has an active community team providing
            online technical support and comprehensive official documentation to guide usage.</li>
    </ul>
